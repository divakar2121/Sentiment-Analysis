# Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Posts using Transformer Models

This repository demonstrates sentiment analysis on a series of social media posts in multiple languages using various pre-trained transformer models. The code compares the confidence scores of five popular models in classifying sentiment, providing insights into their performance.

Overview
The script performs sentiment analysis using the following models:

-DistilBERT (fine-tuned on SST-2)

-BERT

-RoBERTa

-Multilingual BERT (fine-tuned on multilingual data)

-Twitter RoBERTa (fine-tuned on Twitter data)

It evaluates the sentiment of posts in multiple languages and outputs sentiment labels (positive or negative) with confidence scores. A bar chart compares the confidence scores of each model across different posts.
